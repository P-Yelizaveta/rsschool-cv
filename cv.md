### *I have been learning programming for a couple of months now. At first I found it very hard, but now I think so too :) I hope I will not stop trying to learn programming languages and I think I will get something out of it. I like creating things with my own hands, I like it when I can write code. I've already learned the basics of HTML , CSS and JS . I have a vision of how it should look, that it was good and beautiful. So I think I need to keep improving on that.*

### Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* JavaScript Basics
* Figma 
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code

``` function setUserName() {
    var myName = prompt('Твое имя');
    localStorage.setItem('name', myName);
    myHeading.textContent = 'Енот Еноцкий и ' + myName;
};
```
